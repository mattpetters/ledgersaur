# ledgersaur  
[!WIP]
This will error out if you don't have a main.ledger file in the root directory.
Doing some personal testing in dev then will clean it up.

- Using deno 2 rc6
- Mostly to learn fresh but also I need a ledger viewer/mobile update interface


### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
