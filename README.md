# ledgersaur [!WIP] 

This will error out if you don't have a main.ledger file in the root directory.
Doing some personal testing in dev then will clean it up.


### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
